*toolbox* library and utilities
===============================

A set of utilities and library functions to facilitate writing of 
scientific codes -- with a particular focus on the analysis of 
atomistic simulations.

Compilation and dependencies
----------------------------

Compilation of the *toolbox* libraries and tools should not be too
difficult. It requires that FFTW3 and LAPACK libraries are installed
on the system, and a C++ compiler. 

On a Ubuntu system the dependencies can be satisfied by installing

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential liblapack-dev libfftw3-dev
```
Then, compiling *toolbox* should be straightforward:

```bash
cd src
make
```

The resulting executables will be generated in `bin`.

One can modify the default parameters for the compiler and library 
paths by creating a arch.xxx file in the main path, and specifying
which architecture file to load by running

```bash
cd src
ARCH=xxx make
```


icmbpriv20
----------

For some reasons, to successfully compile on my pc, I must add an
-D_IBM to the compilator option. 

I added the arch.icmbpriv20 with the said option. Run

```bash
ARCH=icmbpriv20 make
```

to compile without problems.
